# SoundCore

SoundCore is a Module used to interact with the piped api. The module is meant to be an audio-palyer-management-system, that handles the replay-queue, playlists, history, user management, song/album/artist search, chart(per region) processing and more. There will be another repo in the future called VideoCore, that does the same, but handles piped videos
